# Fact or Fiction Trivia Game

## You've got 20 seconds and 10 questions, good luck!

### Github pages link:  https://boulderbrains.github.io/TriviaGame/

#### Further todos:
- Make the timer stick to the upper left corner of the browsers window, that way the user
can see the timer while answering all questions.

- Replace current questions with "better" ones

- Instead of displaying a full list of questions, display one question at a time. After the user submits and answer to the questions show, that questions is hidden and the next one is shown.
